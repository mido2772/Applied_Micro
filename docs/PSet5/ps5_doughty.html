<p>If I could observe the potential outcomes of each person having taken prelims once or twice, I could simply compare those two outcomes to find the causal effect of taking prelims twice.</p>
<p>In this example, comparing the treated and untreated conditions leads to the conclusion that treatment causes a 5.01-unit (scale unknown) increase in knowledge of micro. This is expected, as the data were generated such that the potential outcome if the exam is taken twice will be on average 5 units higher than the potential outcome in the untreated case.</p>

<p>The selection bias is strong and negative: the potential untreated outcomes differ significantly between the treated and untreated groups, because the groups are selected on the basis of a test outcome that depends (with some measurement error) on the untreated outcome. Specifically, the selection bias should be the difference between average untreated outcomes of the treated group and average untreated outcomes of the untreated group, or -39.58 units. This value is negative because the people with less knowledge of micro are more likely to be assigned to treatment and less likely to score well on any outcomes. In this case, regressions did show that the selection bias made the treatment &ldquo;effect&rdquo; seem 39.57 points lower than the true effect.</p>

<p>This assignment mechanism does not create selection bias, because selection bias is defined as differences in the potential untreated outcomes between the treated and untreated groups. The &ldquo;selection&rdquo; into groups here takes place not based on potential untreated outcomes but on potential treated outcomes.</p>
<p>While the effect found by this selection mechanism is not an average treatment effect, it is a valid causal estimation for the treated group. In this case, the regression shows that the treatment causes a 7.04-unit increase in microeconomics knowledge.</p>
<p>Due to our magical knowledge of everyone&rsquo;s potential outcomes, we can see that this estimate is very similar to the true average causal effect for the treatment group.</p>

<p>This regression indicates that a school spending an additional 1,000 dollars per pupil would be expected to have 0.55 percentage points less of their 4th grade students rated satisfactory in reading.</p>
<p>If I were to include &ldquo;lunch&rdquo; as a variable in the above regression representing students eligible for free- or reduced-price lunch (FRPL), I would expect a negative association between that variable and student performance. Our education system is deeply flawed and tends to give better education to the privileged. Schools serving poorer students (meaning more students eligible for FRPL) are more likely to also have lower test scores.</p>
<p>The other relevant association between FRPL and per-pupil expenditure (PPE) is slightly less certain. On one hand, poorer districts have a weaker property tax base from which to draw their budgets. On the other hand, we have specific programs meant to make up for that gap and give additional money to poorer schools. Let&rsquo;s assume that these programs are sufficiently robust, and poorer districts (higher FRPL) also have more money to spend on their students (higher PPE). If this is true, the coefficient on per-pupil expenditure presented in the prior regression was negatively biased (meaning the true coefficient should be higher).</p>
<p>(I may have made that assumption specifically because I already think the coefficient was negatively biased. All apologies to Hanushek, but I expect a positive association between spending and test scores.)</p>

<p>These scatter plots show our outcome (reading proficiency) and predictor (PPE) of interest, each predicted by the additional covariate (FRPL). By finding the residuals of each of these graphs, we are able to compare the amount of variation that is <em>not</em> accounted for, even after including the influence of FRPL percentage. For example, a school might have a positive residual in the regression of reading proficiency on FRPL, indicating that the school is performing better than would be expected on 4th grade reading test scores based on FRPL percentage. This school will also have a predicted value of PPE, and if that residual is positive as well, that indicates that the school is spending more than would be expected based on the school&rsquo;s FRPL percentage. By considering the two residuals together, we can see whether reading test scores (after accounting for FRPL) are associated with PPE (after accounting for FRPL).</p>
<p>I would not feel justified in applying the conditional independence assumption to this particular regression. There are too many possible ommitted variables. For example, consider the state of a given school. States that prioritize education could plausibly authorize more funding (hence, higher PPE) and put into place other programs and systems designed to increase student achievement (hence, higher test scores). This would positively bias our regression, making it seem as though PPE has a more positive association with student achievement than the reality. Another set of possible ommitted variables describe the racial breakdown of schools. The history (and, frankly, present) of segregation ensures that schools in neighborhoods with more White students are more likely to have a larger property tax base, which increase the amount a school is able to spend on each student. Additionally, our school system advantages White students in many ways (exclusionary pedagogy, discriminatory discipline, and a predominantly White teaching force, to name a few). The ommission of racial breakdown from consideration thus also positively biases our regression. Therefore, we cannot interpret this regression causally.</p>
<h2><a href="#signing-the-bias" id="signing-the-bias">Signing the bias</a></h2>
<p><em>Regression of birthweight on mother&rsquo;s daily smoking</em></p>
<p>An omitted variable here could be the mother&rsquo;s level of drinking. Women who drink alcohol are more likely to smoke. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy is associated with a lower birthweight. Therefore, the bias from this ommitted variable would be negative.</p>
<p><em>Regression of patient’s subjective health on health insurance coverage</em></p>
<p>One omitted variable in this regression could be patient age. Younger patients are less likely to have health insurance (due to both generational wealth gaps and lower risk of serious medical issues). Younger patients are also more likely to feel as though they are healthy. This omitted variable bias would thus be negative.</p>
<p><em>Regression of age at which a young woman becomes sexually active on whether she eats breakfast in the morning</em></p>
<p>Honestly, for this one, the burden is on you to first come up with a plausible causal mechanism. But I suppose extreme poverty could be a possible ommitted variable. Young people living in poverty are more likely to be exposed to food insecurity, which would decrease the likelihood that someone would eat breakfast. Poverty also means that someone is less likely to have access to quality sex ed, which means that a young woman in poverty may not be fully aware of the risks of early sexual activity (which often comes with less reliable contraceptive use) and may begin sexual activity at a younger age. This ommitted variable bias would thus be positive.</p>
<p>Interestingly, no one ever asks me about what correlates with a young man&rsquo;s sexual activity.</p>

<p>About 74% of men received the treatment, while about 26% of women did. This assignment mechanism did create selection bias. The potential untreated outcomes for men and women differ systematically, so selecting disproportionately based on sex resulted in the treated and untreated groups having different potential untreated outcomes.</p>

<p>This regression describes the causal effect of the treatment on the sample population (ATE). We know that the conditional independence assumption holds because women and men were separately randomized into treatment or control. We have assumed that the treatment has a constant effect for men and women (an assumption that we know holds true in this case). We must assume all of our predictors have linear effects: but since both are binary, this assumptions holds. Finally, we must assume that the individual-specific heterogeneity is independent of treatment, additive, and consistent.</p>

<p>This specification finds a treatment effect of 13.5, equivalent to a simple regression of yobs on treated. Because of the sex breakdown of the treatment, the propensity for men to be treated is about 0.74 and for women is about 0.26. These values are within the caliper range of 0.5, so all observations are used as a comparison group. This does not account for the gender-based selection mechanism in any way and thus gives a biased estimate.</p>

<p>This regression yields estimates that better match our understanding of the true causal effect: 8.66 units for TOT, and 7.46 for ATE. The smaller bandwidth ensures that men&rsquo;s observations are only matched with other men&rsquo;s observations, and women&rsquo;s only with other women: given our understanding of the true DGP, this is the best way to approximate the real counterfactual.</p>
